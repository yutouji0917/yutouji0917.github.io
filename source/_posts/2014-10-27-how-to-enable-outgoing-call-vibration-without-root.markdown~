Call Vibrator requires the **radio log** of phone to detect when outgoing call is answered. But since **Android JellyBean(4.1)**, the permission for radio log is not granted to non-system app by default.

If your device is **rooted**, Call Vibrator will prompt a dialog to let user grant the permission to itself.

If your device is **not rooted**, follow the instructions below to grant the permission to Call Vibrator manually.

1. Install the USB driver of your phone

2. On your phone, go to *Settings -> Developer options -> toggle on Android debugging* . (If you don’t  see Developer options in Settings, go to *Settings -> About phone* and tap Build number until you see the message that you are a developer and return to Settings, you will then see Developer options)

3. One your PC, download *Read Log Permission Enabler* script from [here](https://bitbucket.org/shaobin0604/readlogpermissionenabler/downloads/readlogpermissionenabler.zip), it’s about 500KB zip file

4. Unzip the content to `C:\`

   ```
   ├── grant_read_log_permission.bat
   └── libs
        ├── adb.exe
        ├── AdbWinApi.dll
        └── AdbWinUsbApi.dll
   ```

5. Click *Start -> Run*, type `cmd`, when the black window opens up, type:

    ```
    cd C:\readlogpermissionenabler\libs
    ```

    or if you are tired of input commands, just run the script `grant_read_log_permission.bat` located in `C:\readlogpermissionenabler`

9. Unplug your phone from PC

10. Open the Call Vibrator app. Check all the options you need.

11. Try making a call. If the phone does not vibrate, try reboot the phone and then making a call once again.

That's all, have fun with outgoing call vibration.
